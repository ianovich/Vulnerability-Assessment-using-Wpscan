# Vulnerable Wordpress Vulnerability-Assessment-using-Wpscan
This penetration test was conducted on a vulnerable wordpress web application. Multiple vulnerabilities were identified, including outdated software, misconfigurations, and sensitive information disclosure. These issues pose significant security risks and could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, and compromise the integrity of the system.

**Scope**
The scope of this assessment included:<br/>
a. Identifying software and configuration vulnerabilities.<br/>

b. Testing for exposed sensitive information.<br/>

c. Conducting user enumeration and password attacks.<br/>

**FINDINGS**<br/>
1 ![wp1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c67fa849-059a-4fe2-abda-6224d192ee24)

 --url http://IP or domain -Specifies the target WordPress site for scanning, which is a localhost IP address in this case.<br/>
 -e u- Instructs WPScan to enumerate all users on the WordPress site.<br/>
 --usernames root- Targets the root username for a brute force attack to test its validity with various passwords.<br/>
 --passwords /home/viking/wordlist1.txt- Uses a specified password list (wordlist1.txt) for the brute force attack against the root username.<br/>
 --api-token - Provides an API token for accessing the WPScan Vulnerability Database to get up-to-date information on WordPress vulnerabilities.<br/>

 **SERVER INFORMATION DISCLOSURE** <br/>
A .**Headers**<br/>
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)<br/>
This reveals the web server software and version, which could be useful for attackers looking for known vulnerabilities in that specific version of Apache.<br/>

(i) X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.29<br/>
This indicates the PHP version running on the server. Attackers can use this information to target vulnerabilities specific to that PHP version.<br/>

(ii) SecretHeader: SecretValue<br/>
This header seems to be a custom header. It might be an attempt to obscure or provide some internal information. If it's not meant to be public, it could potentially give attackers clues about internal systems or configurations.<br/>

(iii) Squid 1.0.0<br/>
Shows that a Squid proxy is being used. Knowing this helps attackers understand the network infrastructure.<br/>

The above  information allows attackers to target known vulnerabilities associated with these specific versions of Apache, PHP, and Squid. For example, if a particular version of Apache has a known exploit, an attacker could use that information to attempt an attack.<br/>

B **Sensitive Files and Scripts**<br/>
(i)robots.txt
URL- http://127.12.0.1/robots.txt<br/>
This file is typically used to control search engine indexing but sometimes contains information about the siteâ€™s structure or directories to avoid indexing. If it's misconfigured, it could reveal sensitive directories or files.<br/>

(ii)Search Replace DB script<br/>
URL- http://127.12.0.1/searchreplacedb2.php<br/>
This script is used for searching and replacing content in the WordPress database. If accessible, it could be exploited to manipulate database content.<br/>

A **WordPress Configurations**<br/>
XML-RPC Enabled<br/>
URL- http://127.12.0.1/xmlrpc.php<br/>
XML-RPC is a protocol that allows remote procedure calls. It can be used for legitimate purposes but is also susceptible to attacks such as DDoS or brute force attacks. Disclosing this URL could expose the site to these types of attacks.<br/>

4 ![wpscan4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d75500c6-dfe1-4911-aea7-fc88c43eaa18)<br/>

A **Outdated Software**<br/>
Outdated WordPress Version<br/>
Version: 4.2.38<br/>
This is an old version of WordPress, which likely has several known vulnerabilities. Attackers often target outdated software due to the availability of exploit details.<br/>

5 ![wpsacn 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75909c63-0f93-4cff-9807-0da24ea9f848)<br/>
A. **Outdated WordPress Theme**<br/>

B. **Vulnerability Identified**<br/>
Title-Twenty Fifteen Theme <= 1.1 - DOM Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)<br/>

A DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This type of XSS occurs when user input is improperly handled by the client-side JavaScript, potentially allowing an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser.<br/>

Fixed in Version 1.2- The issue was addressed in Twenty Fifteen theme version 1.2. Upgrading to this version would resolve the vulnerability.<br/>

6 ![wpscan6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb372f1d-7553-4f9c-8187-242b79ae3dd2)<br/>

The WPScan identified valid usernames root, mary07, and josh12, using both passive and aggressive detection methods.<br/>

7 ![wpscan7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/242c656f-edfb-420a-b18b-24f463927602)<br/>

 It also revealed that the root account can be accessed with the password admin.<br/>
 
8 ![login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c23483-98e5-414b-8b56-71bdf0dbf876)<br/>
 Trying to login with the credentials given by Wpscan<br/>
 
9 ![login2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c87a360c-8bbc-4ac4-a9df-9216785e2b0b)<br/>
 The screenshot above shows successful login to the WordPress Dashboard using the credentials identified by WPScan. This confirms that the root account with the password admin has access to the site. 

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
Update WordPress and themes to the latest versions.
Secure access to sensitive scripts and files.
Implement stronger password policies.
